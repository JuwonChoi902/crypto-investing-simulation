In this section, we will be replacing the default price formatter function with our implementation. Currently, the prices on the chart are been shown with two decimal places and without a currency symbol. Let's implement a formatter which will format the number correctly based on their current locale and present it as the Euro currency.

## Price Formatter functions

To provide a price formatter, we need to create a function which accepts a `number` as the input and returns a `string` as the output. A simple price formatter which takes a number and returns the number (as a string) formatted with two decimal points would look as follows:

```js
const myPriceFormatter = p => p.toFixed(2);
```

We can make use of the built-in functionality provided by the browser to build a more versatile price formatter by using the [Intl.NumberFormat API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/NumberFormat).

```js
// Get the current users primary locale
const currentLocale = window.navigator.languages[0];
// Create a number format using Intl.NumberFormat
const myPriceFormatter = Intl.NumberFormat(currentLocale, {
    style: 'currency',
    currency: 'EUR', // Currency for data points
}).format;
```

First, we are grabbing the primary locale for the current user which will pass into the `Intl.NumberFormat` constructor. The constructor takes a second argument for options where we can specify the `style` and `currency` properties. The instance created contains a `format` method which we can then pass into Lightweight Charts 9as shown below).

## Setting the price formatter

We can set the default price formatter to be used throughout the chart by passing our own custom price formatter function into the `priceformatter` property of the `localization` property ([LocalizationOptions](/docs/api/interfaces/LocalizationOptions)) within the chart options.

```js
// Apply the custom priceFormatter to the chart
chart.applyOptions({
    localization: {
        priceFormatter: myPriceFormatter,
    },
});
```

Price values displayed on the vertical price scale will now be displayed as Euros.

Price formatters can also be applied to each series individually by adjusting the [priceformat](/docs/api/interfaces/SeriesOptionsCommon#priceformat) property of the series options.

## Built-in price formatting

Lightweight Charts includes a few options to adjust the built-in price formatting which can be see here: [PriceFormatBuiltIn](/docs/api/interfaces/PriceFormatBuiltIn).

## Result

At this point we should have a chart like this:

<iframe
    className="standalone-iframe"
    src={require('!!file-loader!./assets/step4.html').default}
></iframe>
<a href={require('!!file-loader!./assets/step4.html').default} target="\_blank">
    View in a new window
</a>

## Next steps

In the next step, we will be making some adjustments to the functionality of the vertical price scale.
