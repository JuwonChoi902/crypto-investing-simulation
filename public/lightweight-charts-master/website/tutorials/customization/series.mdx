<IterativeGuideWarning/>

In this section, we will be customizing the visual styling of the candlestick series.

We can add our custom options to the series by using the `applyOptions` method on the ISeriesApi instance for the candlestick series. In other words, we can call the `applyOptions` method on the `mainSeries` variable (which was returned when we evoked `addCandlestickSeries()` earlier).

The available options for the candlestick series is a combination of the following interfaces: [CandlestickStyleOptions](/docs/api/interfaces/CandlestickStyleOptions) and [SeriesOptionsCommon](/docs/api/interfaces/SeriesOptionsCommon).

## Setting custom colors for the candlestick series

We are going to set the colors such that upward candles will be a light blue and downward candles will be a vibrant red. The color for the body of the candle is determined by the `upColor` and `downColor` properties, whilst the wick colors are determined by `wickUpColor` and `wickDownColor`. We will additionally disable the border on the candlestick for this example.

We can apply these options at any point in the code after we have created the candlestick series, and in this case, we will place the code below the `setData()` call (but it would still work if was placed before).

```js
mainSeries.setData(candleStickData);

// highlight-start
// Changing the Candlestick colors
mainSeries.applyOptions({
    wickUpColor: 'rgb(54, 116, 217)',
    upColor: 'rgb(54, 116, 217)',
    wickDownColor: 'rgb(225, 50, 85)',
    downColor: 'rgb(225, 50, 85)',
    borderVisible: false,
});
// highlight-end
```

## Result

At this point we should have a chart like this:

<iframe
    className="standalone-iframe"
    src={require('!!file-loader!./assets/step3.html').default}
></iframe>
<a href={require('!!file-loader!./assets/step3.html').default} target="\_blank">
    View in a new window
</a>

## Next steps

In the next step, we will set a price formatter so we can customize the formatting of numbers on the chart.
