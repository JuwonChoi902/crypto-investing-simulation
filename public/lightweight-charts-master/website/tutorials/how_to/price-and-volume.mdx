## How to add a volume histogram

An additional series can be added to a chart as an 'overlay' by setting the series'
[`priceScaleId`](/docs/api/interfaces/SeriesOptionsCommon#pricescaleid) to `''`.
An overlay doesn't make use of either the left or right price scale, and it's positioning
is controlled by setting the [`scaleMargins`](/docs/api/interfaces/PriceScaleOptions#scalemargins)
property on the series options.

```js
const volumeSeries = chart.addHistogramSeries({
    priceFormat: {
        type: 'volume',
    },
    priceScaleId: '', // set as an overlay by setting a blank priceScaleId
    // set the positioning of the volume series
    scaleMargins: {
        top: 0.7, // highest point of the series will be 70% away from the top
        bottom: 0,
    },
});
```

We are using the [Histogram](/docs/series-types#histogram) series type to draw the volume bars.
We can set the `priceFormat` option to `'volume'` to have the values display correctly within
the crosshair line label.

We adjust the position of the overlay series to the bottom 30% of the chart by
setting the [`scaleMargins`](/docs/api/interfaces/PriceScaleOptions#scalemargins) properties as follows:

```js
series.applyOptions({
    scaleMargins: {
        top: 0.7, // highest point of the series will be 70% away from the top
        bottom: 0, // lowest point will be at the very bottom.
    },
});
```

Similarly, we can set the position of the main series using the same approach. By setting
the `bottom` margin value to `0.4` we can ensure that the two series don't overlap each other.

```js
mainSeries.applyOptions({
    scaleMargins: {
        top: 0.1, // highest point of the series will be 10% away from the top
        bottom: 0.4, // lowest point will be 40% away from the bottom
    },
});
```

We can control the color of the histogram bars by directly specifying color inside
the data set.

```js
histogramSeries.setData([
    { time: '2018-10-19', value: 19103293.0, color: 'green' },
    { time: '2018-10-20', value: 20345000.0, color: 'red' },
]);
```
