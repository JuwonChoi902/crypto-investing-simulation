It is possible to have two price scales visible on a Lightweight Chart,
namely one on the right side (default) and another on the left. This example
shows how to configure your chart to contain two price scales.

## Short answer

Ensure that `rightPriceScale` and `leftPriceScale` has the `visibility` property
set to `true` within the [chart options](/docs/api/interfaces/ChartOptions#leftpricescale).

```js
chart.applyOptions({
    rightPriceScale: {
        visible: true,
    },
    leftPriceScale: {
        visible: true,
    },
});
```

and assign the `priceScaleId` property on the [series options](/docs/api/interfaces/SeriesOptionsCommon#pricescaleid)
for the series which you would like to use the left scale. Note that by default a
series will use the right scale thus we don't need to set that property on the other series.

```js
const leftSeries = chart.addCandlestickSeries(
    { priceScaleId: 'left' }
);
```

You can see a full [working example](#full-example) below.

## Tips

By default the crosshair will snap to the data points of the first series.
You may prefer to set the [crosshair mode](/docs/api/enums/CrosshairMode) to
`normal` so that you get a crosshair which allows sits directly beneath your cursor.

```js
chart.applyOptions({
    crosshair: {
        mode: 0, // CrosshairMode.Normal
    },
});
```
