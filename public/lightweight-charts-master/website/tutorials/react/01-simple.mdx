# React - Simple example

:::info

The following only describes a relatively simple example that only renders an [area series](/docs/series-types#area) that could be tweaked to render any other type of [series](/docs/series-types).

For a more complete scenario where you could wrap Lightweight Charts into a component having sub components, please consult this [example](./advanced).

:::

On this page you will learn how to easily use Lightweight Charts with React.

## Preparing your project

For the example purpose we are using [Parcel starter kit](https://github.com/brandiqa/react-parcel-starter) but feel free to use any other tool or starter kit.

```console
git clone git@github.com:brandiqa/react-parcel-starter.git lwc-react
cd lwc-react
npm install
```

To run your project simply

```console
npm start
```

This will create a web page accessible by default on <http://localhost:1234/>.

## Creating a charting component

The example _React component_ on this page may not fit your requirements completely. Creating a general purpose declarative wrapper for Lightweight Charts' imperative API is a challenge, but hopefully you can adapt this example to your use case.

:::info

For this example we are using props to set chart colors based on the current theme (light or dark). In your real code it might be a better idea to use a [Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html#when-to-use-context).
:::

import { ThemedChart } from '@site/src/components/tutorials/themed-chart-colors-wrapper';
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import code from '!!raw-loader!@site/src/components/tutorials/simple-react-example';

<CodeBlock replaceThemeConstants className="language-jsx">{code}</CodeBlock>

and you'll have a reusable component that could then be enhanced, tweaked to meet your needs, adding properties and even functionalities.

If you've successfully followed all the steps you should see something similar to

import { App } from '@site/src/components/tutorials/simple-react-example';
import styles from '@site/src/pages/chart.module.css';

<div className={styles.ChartContainer}>
    <ThemedChart ChartComponent={App}/>
</div>
